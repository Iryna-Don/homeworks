We use the present simple to talk about things in general. We use it to say that something happens all the
time or repeatedly, or that something is true in general:

In the following examples, do is also the main verb (do you do / doesn’t do etc.):

Sometimes we do things by saying something. For example, when you promise to do something,
you can say ‘I promise … ’; when you suggest something, you can say ‘I suggest … ’:
I promise I won’t be late. (not I’m promising)
‘What do you suggest I do?’ ‘I suggest that you …’
In the same way we say: I apologise … / I advise … / I insist … / I agree … / I refuse … etc.
